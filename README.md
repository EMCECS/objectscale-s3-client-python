# objectscale-s3-client-python
ObjectScale S3 Client for Python (based on boto3)

## Project summary

This is a library developed for Dell Technologies extending the boto3 Python library for metadata search calls.

The library takes existing S3 API calls designed for boto3 and implements new search indexes for metadata search functionality. It also generates new S3 API calls with metadata search functionality. A stretch goal for the project is implementation of client-side load balancing to improve preformance of the boto3 library.
