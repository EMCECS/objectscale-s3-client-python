# Contributing to our Project
We appreciate contributions to the objectscale-s3-client-python library and its documentation.

## Introduction

A Dell project maintainer will be responsible for accepting contributions but only if they adhere to the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 which can be found at https://developercertificate.org. 

## Developer Certificate of of Origin
Contributions can agree to the DCO by using a signed-off-by line at the end of each commit message. An example of this message is as follows:

```
Signed-off-by: Drayer Sivertsen <drayer.sivertsen@email.com>
```

This message can be added to your commit message. However, Git supports a much easier way to add this to your commit messages. 

If you set up "user.name" and "user.email" as part of your git configuration, you can sign each commit by just using: 
```
git commit -s
```

Configuring git can be done using the commands:
```
//add username
git config --global user.name "your_username"

//add email
git config --global user.email "your_email_address@example.com"
```

The below text of the DCO is from https://developercertificate.org:
