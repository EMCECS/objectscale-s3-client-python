# Sprint x Report (8/26/21 - 9/24/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Published the project to testpypi
 * Defined the copyright process
 * Defined adding new request objects to new request methods
 * Defined adding new response objects to new request methods

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
After our break through that occured last sprint we found that the spikes assigned to our group this sprint were accomplished much more smoothly. Two of our team members took on spikes that involved defining the shape of new request or response objects. Nathan was able to complete the request and response objects for the new methods effectively using the boto3 library for reference and other sources on API shapes. Killian however due to limited availbility was unable to complete defining a new request object to the extend methods. This spikes lack of completion was simply a time constraint as the work that Nathan completed was very similar and accomplishable. This spike will roll over to the next sprint and should have no issues being completed in that timeline.

The copyright spike came as a small hurdle for our team because it had reach into many portions of the project. Not only did a contributing and notice file need to be added but all python files in the project had to add a header. This set a new standard to be followed by our team and meant changing the top of even our current sprint files. 

One significant learning from this sprint is that our team has realized as the holiday season and course finals approach we have less time to allocate for each sprint. This is an obstacle that our team can't avoid as more responsibilities simply allow for less time on the project. Our next sprint will resume at the start of January so we should be able to be much more productive at the start of the semester and after the holidays are over. 

## Unfinished Work
As I touched on in the work summary our only unfinished work was defining how to modify a request object in our extend methods. There has been no progress towards completion of this spike and it was not completed due to lack of work time by one of our team members. This spike has been rolled over to sprint 4 and should have no problems being completed in that time.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Communication with Dell mentor
  * Demo of completed spikes
  * Workload assignment spikes
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Better communication about progress of spikes
   * More collaboration within the team
   * Completion of all spikes in a sprint
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Assignment of sprint lead role to team member
   * Stronger backlog refinement before spike assignment
   * During the week progress updates on spikes
