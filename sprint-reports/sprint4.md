# Sprint x Report (4/2/23 - 5/2/23)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Publication to PyPi
 * Client MVP Demo
 * OSS Manifest
 * .NET target versions

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint we were finally able to complete the Python client library to its production specs, which was concluded with the official publication to PyPi. Our client requested a GUI implementation of our library to be completed in the Client MVP Demo, where we used the published library to make metadata query requests on buckets from a Pizza Restaurant located in Pullman WA. This took place using a python GUI designer called QT Designer, the python code would display diet restrictions and allow users to see pizzas that fit the diet. 

The last stage of the documentation publication also was completed with an OSS Manifest that documented all of our project dependencies to provide to Dell clear our Github to be public. This would allow for a gh-pages branch to host the already completed web documentation.

We began to move into work for the .NET project and determining the correct versions to targets proved to be fairly difficult. It took a couple of meeting to clarify the library use cases before ultimately finding the best version. 

Our team learned a great deal about the final steps needed legally to get a open source library published. 

## Unfinished Work
All work was completed and our final publications took place.
